# DiscordBot

A simple Discord bot for my friend group server.

The bot is written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) using the [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org/#/) module. This bot was developed in collaboration with [a friend](https://github.com/cdl-rajesh)

This is a public-friendly version of the repo without any sensitive information that I will do my best to keep updated as the bot is developed over time.
